In this assignment, we are to create a database called "bamazon_db;" using MySQL Workbench and within that database we also create a table called "products".

In the table products we create columns as listed:
-item_id
-product_name
-department_name
-price
-stock_quantity

We then create a CLI App that will prompt the user a welcoming message followed by a series of prompts asking what the user wants to buy from the displayed inventory and however many of products they would like to purchase. 

Once the user chooses the item + quantity, the stock quantity gets updated in the database.
